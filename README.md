# Wi-Fi Jammer
Wi-Fi Jammer (De-authenticator) application with an Avalonia UI frontend. Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with the official touch screen
## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen Display
- A wireless adapter capable of monitor mode, I used the `ALFA AWUS036NH`
- A case for the screen, I had one 3D printed from a design I found on Thingiverse [(link)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1585924)

## TODO List
- [ ] Error handling for no network interfaces detected
- [ ] Improve JamAP and JamClient functions if necessary
- [ ] Figure out channel switching (!!!)
- [ ] Configure relative paths for CSV files
- [ ] Improve README
